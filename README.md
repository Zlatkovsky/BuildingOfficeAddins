# Building Office Add-ins using Office.js

## The everygreen book

This repo is a sample-code and issue-tracking companion to the book ["Building Office Add-ins using Office.js"](https://leanpub.com/buildingofficeaddins/) -- an "evergreen" e-book published and purchasable through [LeanPub.com](https://leanpub.com/buildingofficeaddins/).

From the book description:

> This book is a guide to Office.js APIs, which are used to build the web-technology-based Office Add-ins. Is describes the principles and design patterns shared by the new 2016+ wave of APIs for Excel, Word, and OneNote -- written by someone who, as member of the Office Extensibility Platform team at Microsoft, had helped design them. 

&nbsp;

## This repo's purpose is to:

**\#1: Allow me to share the larger code samples and associated assets** (e.g., documents with sample data, geared specifically for the scenario).

**\#2: Provides readers with a way to log and track content issues (and be informed once they are fixed).  Issues can be:**

  * Simple content issues: A misspelling, an incomplete phrase, a sentence that no longer makes sense.
  * Requests for additional detail in *existing* topics.
  * Requests for *brand new topics*. I might already be planning to write something about it eventually, but this will let you subscribe to finding out when the content is made available; and will also help me gauge topic interest.
  * Issues with sample code or related assets: code is unclear; the design is sub optimal; something needs a comment; or perhaps an existing comment needs to be clarified or removed.
  * Anything else?

**\#3: Keep track of the [Release notes](Release-Notes.md)**.

## If you have questions about specific APIs, please use StackOverflow.

This repo is meant for aggregating book issues -- but the book's purpose is *not* to cover every single API, but rather to cover the common concepts.  If you have a question about a specific API, please use [**StackOverflow**, tagging your question **office-js**](stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/office-js).

In fact, even if your question *is* about a core concept, I still encourage you to ask it on StackOverflow first, as you'll almost certainly get a quicker response there (and if the response is from me, it might well make it into the book eventually!).  This repo is for *tracking* the issues and topics, but addressing questions is best done through [**StackOverflow**](stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/office-js).
